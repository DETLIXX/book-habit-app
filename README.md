# 📚 Book Habit Tracker

### What is Book Habit Tracker?

**Book Habit Tracker** is a simple yet powerful habit-tracking app to help you stay consistent in your reading journey.  
It features:

- 🟩 **One clean screen**
- 📊 **Contribution graph** to visualize your reading streak
- ⏱ **Timer** to track how long you've read each day

Everything is optimized for productivity with a clean, JetBrains Mono-inspired design.

### Why did I build this?

Honestly, I personally struggle with building habits.  
Even after reading a few pages of _Atomic Habits_ (awesome book, even though I haven’t finished it), I couldn't keep my 20-minute daily reading routine going.

So I thought: _Why not build my own simple app?_  
No subscriptions. No bloated features. Just a side project built in **3 days** – for myself, and for free.

### 🛠 For devs

- Built with **React Native + Expo**
- 100% **local-first** – no backend required
- My first app that doesn't use **NestJS + MongoDB** combo 😄
